This is a simple exercise I did in University. Some of the code was provided to me by the university.

The model is created using a keras.

This is the model summary.

I tested 2 different results. One with the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer and one with the Adam optimizer.
Results are shown below:

As can be seen the Adam optimizer was more accurate than the SGD one.
